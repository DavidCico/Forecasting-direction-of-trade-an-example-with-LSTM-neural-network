## Getting Started

<p align="justify">These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</p>

### Prerequisites

<p align="justify">You need <strong>Python 3.x</strong> to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems. Python needs to be first installed then <strong>SciPy</strong> and <strong>pymysql</strong> as there are dependencies on packages.</p>

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Alongside Python, the SciPy packages are also required. In Ubuntu and Debian, the SciPy ecosystem can be installed by:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
    
The latest release of Scikit-Learn machine learning package, which can be installed with pip:
    
    pip install -U scikit-learn

Finally, the Tensorflow package for neural networks modelling, which can be installed with pip:
    
    pip install tensorflow

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at:
